Therapist: Good morning, Sarah. How have you been since our last session?

Client: Hi. It's been... okay, I guess. The anxiety has been pretty bad this week though. I had a few panic attacks at work.

Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

Client: Yeah, so on Tuesday I was in a meeting and suddenly I just felt my heart racing. My hands got sweaty and I couldn't focus on what anyone was saying. I had to excuse myself and go to the bathroom.

Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What were you thinking about when you noticed your heart racing?

Client: I was thinking about the project deadline. My manager was asking about the timeline and I just felt like I was going to mess everything up. Like everyone was counting on me and I was going to let them down.

Therapist: It sounds like there were some strong thoughts about disappointing others and not meeting expectations. Is that something that comes up often for you?

Client: All the time. I've always been like this. Even as a kid, I would get so stressed about tests that I'd make myself sick.

Therapist: You mentioned this pattern goes back to childhood. That's really valuable insight. What do you remember about those early experiences?

Client: My parents had really high expectations. They always wanted me to be the best. If I got a B, they'd ask why it wasn't an A. I just always felt like nothing was ever good enough.

Therapist: That sounds like a lot of pressure for a young person. It makes sense that you'd develop some anxiety around performance when approval was tied to achievement.

Client: I never really thought about it that way. I always just thought something was wrong with me.

Therapist: There's nothing wrong with you, Sarah. You learned a way of coping with a challenging environment. And now we can work on developing new strategies that serve you better.

Client: That would be really helpful. I'm tired of feeling this way.

Therapist: I hear that. Let's talk about some techniques you can use when you notice the anxiety building. Have you tried any breathing exercises?

Client: I've heard of them but I never really knew how to do them properly.

Therapist: That's something we can definitely work on. One technique is called box breathing - you breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, and hold for 4. Would you like to try it now?

Client: Sure, let's try it.

Therapist: How did that feel?

Client: Actually, pretty good. I feel a bit calmer now.

Therapist: Great. For homework this week, I'd like you to practice this breathing exercise twice a day - once in the morning and once before bed. And if you feel anxiety building at work, try using it then too.

Client: I can do that.

Therapist: I also noticed something important - you mentioned you're really reliable and your coworkers count on you. That suggests you have a strong work ethic and people trust you. Can you see that as a strength?

Client: I guess when you put it that way... yeah, people do trust me with important things.

Therapist: That's worth remembering. You've clearly demonstrated competence at work, even while dealing with this anxiety. That takes real strength.

Client: Thank you. I don't usually think about it like that.

Therapist: Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind?

Client: No, I think this was really helpful. I feel like I understand myself a bit better now.

Therapist: I'm glad. Remember, we're building skills over time. It's okay if the anxiety doesn't disappear overnight. Each small step is progress.

Client: I'll try to remember that.

Therapist: Same time next week?

Client: Yes, that works for me. Thank you.
