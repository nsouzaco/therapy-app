Therapist: Hi Marcus, come on in. How has your week been?

Client: Not great, honestly. I've been really struggling.

Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?

Client: The drinking has gotten worse again. I told myself I'd only have a couple beers, but I ended up blacking out on Saturday. I woke up and didn't remember how I got home.

Therapist: That sounds scary. How are you feeling about that now?

Client: Ashamed. Angry at myself. I keep making promises I can't keep. My wife is really upset with me.

Therapist: It takes courage to be honest about this. I appreciate you telling me. Have there been any other concerning moments this week?

Client: On Sunday I felt so low... I just didn't want to get out of bed. I kept thinking, what's the point? I'm just going to screw everything up again anyway.

Therapist: When you say "what's the point," can you tell me more about those thoughts?

Client: Just that... I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if everyone would be better off without me. Like I'm just a burden.

Therapist: Marcus, I need to ask you directly - have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Client: No, not really. I mean, I've thought about what it would be like to just... not exist. But I wouldn't actually do anything.

Therapist: Thank you for being honest with me. Those kinds of thoughts can be really painful. Have you thought about how you might do it?

Client: No, I haven't planned anything. I don't want to die, I just... I want the pain to stop, you know?

Therapist: I hear you. That desire for the pain to stop makes sense. You're dealing with a lot right now - the drinking, the strain on your marriage, feeling like you're letting people down.

Client: Yeah, it's all just piling up.

Therapist: Given what you've shared today, I think it would be helpful for us to create a safety plan together. This is something you can refer to if those dark thoughts get stronger.

Client: Okay.

Therapist: First, let's identify some warning signs - things that tell you you might be heading to a difficult place.

Client: When I start drinking more. When I isolate myself. When I pick fights with Michelle.

Therapist: Good awareness. And what are some things you can do on your own to cope when you notice those signs?

Client: I could go for a walk, I guess. Or call my brother. He's been supportive.

Therapist: Those are excellent. Your brother sounds like an important resource. Let's also talk about reasons you have for living.

Client: My kids. I love my kids. Even when I feel like a bad father, I know they need me.

Therapist: That's powerful, Marcus. Hold onto that. Your kids love you and need you in their lives.

Client: I know. That's what keeps me going.

Therapist: I'd also like to discuss whether seeing someone about medication might be helpful. Depression and alcohol use often go together, and addressing both can make a real difference.

Client: I've been resistant to pills, but... maybe it's worth considering.

Therapist: It's worth an evaluation at least. I can give you a referral to a psychiatrist I trust.

Client: Okay. Yeah, I'll think about it.

Therapist: For this week, I want you to commit to two things. First, attend an AA meeting - even just one. Second, reach out to your brother and tell him you're struggling.

Client: I can do that.

Therapist: And Marcus - if those thoughts about not existing get stronger, or if you start thinking about specific ways to hurt yourself, I want you to call me, call the crisis line, or go to the emergency room. Can you commit to that?

Client: Yeah. I will.

Therapist: You're taking important steps by being here and being honest. That takes real strength.
